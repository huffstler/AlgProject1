Finished Tasks:
	Reading Text into a graph object
	
Mostly Complete tasks:
	Part 2, finding the child with most children from given Vertice
	
Not Yet Complete Tasks:
	Part 1, Returning certain amount of vertices of order x from vertice "string"
	Part 3, finding lowest common ancestor of SP2 and SP3
	
What could we do to improve?
	We want to use a hashmap to further increase the speed of inserting and finding the objects in our graph, we did not have time to add the feature in without bugs however.
	Part 2 currently finds vertices based on numbers not strings. It's an easy fix once we have a little more time with the program.
	Part 1 and 3 need a little more time to complete. Especially part 3 because of its complexity compared to the other parts of the program.
